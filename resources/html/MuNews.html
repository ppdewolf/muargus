<h2>Last modified:December 2013</h2>
<hr><i>December 2013: </i> The procedures to read SPSS have been upgraded for SPSS20.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Attention:</b> the files 'clientscriptingcfg.ini' and 'spssdxcfg.ini' must have been installed
 in 'C:\Program Files\IBM\SPSS\Statistics\20'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is part of the SPSS installation (Python extension)
<hr><i>March 2010: </i> Reading SPSS was not correct. Related vars were not stored correctly in the output file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Not used variables could cause a problem.

<hr><i>November 2009: </i> Record linkage pocedure included
